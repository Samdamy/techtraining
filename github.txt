What Is GitHub?
GitHub is a Git repository hosting service that provides a web-based graphical interface (GUI). It helps every team member work together on a project from anywhere, making it easy to collaborate. 

GitHub is one place where project managers and developers coordinate, track, and update their work, so projects stay transparent and on schedule. The packages can be published privately, within the team, or publicly for the open-source community. Downloading packages from GitHub enables them to be used and reused. GitHub helps all team members stay on the same page and stay organized. Moderation tools, like issue and pull request locking, helps the team focus on the code.
